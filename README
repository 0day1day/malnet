1. What is MalNET?
------------------
MalNET is a python application to help assist in the diagnosis of machines infected with malware 
in a corporate environment. MalNET is designed to be a low interaction web server which can be 
used to communicate with malware attempting to download via http. When an infected host attempts 
to download badfile.exe from a host which has been blackholed in DNS (more on this later..), the 
MalNET application will ALWAYS return a "200 OK" response, essentially making the malware 
downloader believe the malware is on the way. From an incident response perspective all you really 
want is the URL of the file the malware is attempting to download, for which you can then download 
yourself and unpack/analyse/scan etc for any follow up.

2. Blackhole DNS
------------------
Many corporate environments and research organisations are now setting up DarkNETs, these are not 
new. However for much more than the 'ooh, aah' factory and some research statistics, they are pretty 
much useless. Some environments running DarkNETs are now starting to redirect blackhole'd DNS 
traffic into their DarkNET, essentially polluting their DarkNET environment. The MalNET application 
is designed to be used in conjunction with something like the malwaredomains.com blackhole'd DNS list, 
redirecting all of your blackholed DNS traffic to the host running MalNET.

3. Usage
------------------
Not much to it really;

sudo python ./malnet.py <port>

<port> defaults to port 80 if none specified

4. About
------------------
This application is in the very early stages and is a way for me to learn more about python. Since 
I have a strong interest in python+malware/incident response/ids etc, this should be pretty fun. Bugs, 
comments etc to brainiac3@evilnerds.net

peace out!
